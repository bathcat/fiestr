00. Free Square
01. What's the deal with `<FlatList>`? 
	* Native built-in component 
	* Comes with stuff:
	  - Scrolling
	  - Paging
	  - Header / footer
	  - Columns
	* Like array.map(()=>{});
	* Renders lazily. Virtualized.

02. What's up with `useState` and `useRef` 
* Both store state
* Rerender with useState
* `useRef` 

03. How do you publish to google play?
  - Build binaries: expo cloud services or XCode or android studio.
  - Whole process

04. Difference between react and react-native?
  - Different components
  - Styles - no selectors on native, no inheritance

05. What's the deal with `useEffect`
  - Something outside of react
  - Something with side effects
  - Talk to API
  - NOT for data transformation
